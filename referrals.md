The following lists my various referral links for services I use, and why I picked them compared to their competitors.

Feel free to use any of the links below, or tell me why you think a different service is a better alternative.

|Service|Link/Code|Reason|
|-| --- | ----- |
|Up Bank|[Referral Link](https://hook.me.up/nick)|Up Bank is owned by Bendigo Bank which is divested from fossil fuels, and also has the most advanced features of any bank I've seen, pay splitting, custom PayIDs, API access, to the minute scheduling|
|Doordash|[Referral Link](https://drd.sh/BIiqxXJYh2uXTP0N)|Doordash seems to be the best delivery service for commissions for the restaurant|
|[Belong](https://www.belong.com.au)| IAFY422F7 | Carbon Neutral, with unlimited data banking, Telstra Network, Cheap plans (I'm on their legacy $10 plan, but they also offer a $15 plan)|
|Raiz|[Referral Link](https://app.raizinvest.com.au/invite/RZ2Z84)|I like them as a micro-investing platform for putting your excess funds of the month into the market, I think they used to hold a more unique position, but First Step and Spaceship now fulfill similar roles|
|Pearler|[Referral Link](https://pearler.com/invited/NICK50821)|Allows for the actual purchase of ETFs, CHESS Sponsored, low brokerage fees|
|[Spaceship](https://www.spaceship.com.au/)| S8JBLSM40Z | Very similar to Raiz, but seems to have a better fee structure, appears similar to a tech focused ETF |
|Afterpay|[Referral Link](https://fbuy.io/ap-anz/nickwolf)|I only recommend using pay later services if you have good impulse purchase control|
