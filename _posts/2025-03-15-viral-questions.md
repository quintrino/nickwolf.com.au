As someone who deeply enjoys my questions, I will occasionally get asked for ideas on good questions.

So, as with all things in depends on the circumstance, and questions for connection, are different than questions for understanding.

One of the question types that I've enjoyed previously, and still get a lot of value out of today is that of *Viral Questions*.

A viral question in this context is one that potentially facilitates future questions.

Some of my favourites are:

* *Who is the coolest person I should meet?*
* *What is the best event I should go to?*
* *What experience do you think I would get a lot out of?*

Each of these questions has the potential for you to connect with or attend something else, where you can again, repeat the question, allowing
you to meet more cool people, attend more events, and experience more.
