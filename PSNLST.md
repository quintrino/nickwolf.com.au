This evocative art work lays bare the impotence of seeking a life full of passion and creativity, only to discover that time is disappointedly filled with work and 'adulting' instead. In displaying these items prepared for use, the artist urges us to fight against neglecting our passions and invites us to consider their place in our lives.
