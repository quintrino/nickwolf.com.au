Created in a moment of craving peace during The Before Time, the artist elicits a sense of serenity. Viewed now, the piece hearkens back to a simpler time when everyday trivialities took pride of place in most people's lives. The dynamic brush strokes in this artwork make it especially powerful viewed while on psychedelics.
