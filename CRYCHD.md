The details surrounding the sudden appearance of this piece within the collection one day has been subject to much debate. However, all viewers have agreed that the subject's crying eyes have the eerie habit of following you around the room. At one point in this particular piece's history, a second artist attempted to alleviate this sensation by decorating over the eyes, however the 'creepiness' of the painting remains.

Some legends exist saying that covering the eyes will not prevent the child from watching all your doings, as he can see you all the time, everywhere. Historians, on investigating the origins of this piece further, have found tales of owners attempting to rid themselves of this curse by burning the painting, only to be driven mad when the image of the boy remains, staring at them as the painting is engulfed in flames.
